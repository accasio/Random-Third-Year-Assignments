The client should have a simple GUI that allows the user to specify whether to upload or download a file, as well as the file name (or file directory).

Include a pdf file showing the operation of the GUI (1 mark)
Comment your code appropriately, including your details (name, ID number) in each java file.  Submit your assignment in the form Assignment9_firstname_lastname.zip (1 mark)  


 this assignment is notably longer than the other assignments - it is strongly recommended that you do not leave it to the last week. Also that an IP address may be used instead of a host name (and 127.0.0.1 is to connect to the same computer), and remember thatFileInputStream and FileOutputStream are used to convert bytes into a file.
 
Part B
Create server and client programs that allows a user to enter their name in the client and pass it to the server and return this information to the client console.

Use Datagram sockets to implement this using send and receive methods (5 mark)

Include Screen Shot of your results and Java Files
