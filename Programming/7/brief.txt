 Implement a FIFO queue up to some bounded maximum size to hold String objects that can be accessed by multiple Producer and Consumer threads. The Producer threads produce String objects while the Consumer threads consume these objects. Every String object produced must be consumed exactly once.  Use the ReentrantLock class and Condition variables in your implementation.

Write an application class that create a random number of Producer and Consumer threads at startup to test your implementation.

Print out queue statistics e.g. number of items in the queue and thread access details as the simulation progresses. 

Keep your code simple and elegant. Use comments to explain your code. Include all relevant screenshots (1 mark).
